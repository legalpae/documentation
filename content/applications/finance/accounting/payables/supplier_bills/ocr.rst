Configuration
=============

Digitalization is an In-App Purchase (IAP) service that requires prepaid credits to work. To buy
credits, go to Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings ‣ Digitization and click on *Buy credits*.
Or go to General Settings ‣ Contacts  ‣ Odoo IAP and click on *View My Services*.

.. note::
   If you are on Odoo Online (SAAS) and have the Enterprise version, you benefit from free trial
   credits to test the feature.

In the Accounting Settings ‣ Digitalization, choose whether the Vendor Bills and Customer Invoices
should be processed automatically (with OCR) or manually (on demand).

The *Single Invoice Line Per Tax* option can also be selected. It enables to get only one line
created per tax in the new bill, despite the number of lines from the invoice.

Digitalizing Vendor Bills
=========================

Your Vendor Bills can be uploaded from the Accounting Dashboard or by going to  Accounting ‣ Vendors
‣ Bills. Based on your configuration, it either processes the documents automatically, or you need
to click on *Send for Digitalization* to do it manually.

Digitalizing Customer Invoices
==============================

From the Accounting Dashboard, select the extra menu field (⋮) in the Customer Invoices journal, and
select Upload Invoices. Or go to Accounting ‣ Customers ‣ Invoices and select Upload.

.. note::
   - The more documents you scan, the better the system identifies the correct data.
   - If the document you upload contains several bills, the OCR detects them automatically and the
     Documents App can split them all.
   - You can also create and upload your documents from the Documents App.
   - Once the data is extracted from the PDF, you can correct it if necessary by clicking on the
     respective tag (available in Edit mode), and selecting the right information instead.
